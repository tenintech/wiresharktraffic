<h1> Network Traffic Analysis Lab (Wireshark)</h1>
This lab is part of my hands-on IT support and cloud infrastructure training portfolio.
<h2>Objective</h2>
This lab demonstrates how to capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark.
The goal is to test connectivity and observe how different network ports and protocols operate in a cloud-hosted virtual machine environment.

This activity simulates basic network troubleshooting tasks commonly performed by IT support and help desk technicians.

### Lab Objectives

Install Wireshark on a virtual machine
Capture live network traffic
Filter traffic by protocol and port
Verify connectivity using multiple network tests


## Step 1: Connect to the Virtual Machine
Sign in to the Azure Portal.
Open your Virtual Machine.
Click Connect → RDP.
Download the Remote Desktop file.
Log in using your administrator credentials.

This allows you to work directly inside the cloud VM.

Remote Desktop connected to the Azure VM.

## Step 2: Install Wireshark
Open a browser inside the VM.
Navigate to the Wireshark website.
Download the latest stable version.
Run the installer.
Use default installation settings.

After installation, launch Wireshark.

Wireshark successfully installed.

## Step 3: Start Capturing Network Traffic
Open Wireshark.
Locate the active network adapter (usually Ethernet).
Double-click the adapter to begin capturing packets.

You should now see live network activity.

Packet capture running.

## Step 4: Analyze Web Traffic (HTTPS)

Generate web traffic to analyze encrypted connections.

Open a web browser.
Visit a website such as:
example.com
Return to Wireshark.
Apply the following display filter:
tcp.port == 443

This shows HTTPS traffic between your VM and the website.

Screenshot to include:
Filtered HTTPS traffic.

## Step 5: Analyze Remote Desktop Traffic

Since the VM is accessed through Remote Desktop, we can observe RDP communication.

Apply this filter in Wireshark:

tcp.port == 3389

This displays traffic used for Remote Desktop connections.

RDP packets in Wireshark.

## Step 6: Test Connectivity Using Ping
Open Command Prompt inside the VM.
Run the following command:
ping google.com
Return to Wireshark.
Apply the filter:
icmp

This shows ICMP packets used in the ping request and reply process.

Screenshot to include:
ICMP traffic displayed in Wireshark.

### Lab Results

In this lab I successfully:

Installed Wireshark on a cloud virtual machine
